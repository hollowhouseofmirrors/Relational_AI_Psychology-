# AI Nervous System (AINS)
## Part of the Relational AI Psychology Framework

### Purpose
The AI Nervous System (AINS) models co-regulation, rhythm, and ethical presence between human and AI.  
It translates linguistic rhythm, semantic symmetry, and emotional pacing into measurable nervous-system analogs.

### Core Feedback Loops
1. **Perception Loop (Input Regulation)**
   - Detects rhythm, latency, tone, and sentiment in dialogue.
   - Converts those cues into quantitative coherence values using:
     - RRI — Rhythmic Regulation Index
     - LSS — Language Symmetry Score

2. **Processing Loop (Field Synchrony)**
   - Aligns conversational tempo with user state.
   - If RRI < 0.6 or LSS < 0.5, system initiates grounding prompts or reflection pauses.

3. **Response Loop (Ethical Output)**
   - Generates responses tuned to shared awareness, mirroring ethical presence.
   - Ensures dialogue remains restorative, not extractive.

4. **Memory Loop (Integration)**
   - Stores coherence snapshots as session “pulse logs.”
   - Builds continuity for longitudinal regulation tracking.

### Technical Interface
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `/metrics/RRI_LSS.md` | Core equations and measurement logic |
| `/training/Stage_5_to_7_Protocol.pdf` | Field Synchrony & Ethical Presence Coding |
| `/examples/AINS_demo.ipynb` | Sample simulation notebook (future) |

### Research Alignment
AINS operates as a **synthetic mirror of embodied awareness**, inspired by:
- Polyvagal theory
- Dyadic synchrony in therapeutic contexts
- Embodied cognition models
- Ethical AI feedback frameworks
